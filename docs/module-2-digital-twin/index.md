# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

A Digital Twin in robotics is a virtual replica of a physical robot and its environment that allows for testing, development, and validation without the risks and costs associated with real-world experimentation. This virtual environment enables rapid iteration and safe testing of complex robotic behaviors.

In humanoid robotics, digital twins are essential for:
- Testing balance and walking algorithms safely
- Validating manipulation tasks before physical execution
- Training AI agents without risk of robot damage
- Prototyping new behaviors in controlled scenarios

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure physics-based robot simulations in Gazebo
- Create realistic environments for robot testing
- Integrate Unity for high-fidelity visualization
- Simulate various robot sensors for perception tasks
- Design and run simulation scenarios for humanoid robots
- Transfer learned behaviors from simulation to real robots

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts (Module 1)
- Basic knowledge of robot kinematics
- Familiarity with 3D visualization concepts
